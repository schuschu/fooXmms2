This part is about the things that are wrong in the current version:

  The action architecture: different backends have different actions,
  forcing a playlist backend to have a play selected action is imply wrong
  -> a keypress event will be send to the backends actionhandler(?) and 
     will there do whatever it is supposed to do
  
  The plugin architecture: there is no plugin architecture. in a later
  release this project will be moved to a plugin framework 
  -> http://jpf.sourceforge.net/index.html or a similar framework
  
  The configuration architecture: there is no configuration architecture.
  in a later release a xml based configuration file will be created in 
  the xmms2 client directory (or closer to the client?)
  -> utfg
