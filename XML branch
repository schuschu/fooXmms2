XML branch TODOs

Move parsing of elements to factory and pass them as vararg/map

Create Tray from XML

Use dependencies for layout
alternatives: 
1.) create a array of layoutdata elements and parse them last
2.) separate layoutdata form window (unnatural,seperate factory?)
Remove/Rethink composites for playlistplayback

Missing TAGS!!!

style (via int - unreadable, unique attributes - many, 
groups/presets - limited options)

icons/images (essential for buttons and shell, unicode is no fun under xp)

Remove all white bg, (black fg)

client node default params (in loader)
