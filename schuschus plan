This part is about the things that are wrong in the current version:

  The documentation. it is getting a little messy...

  The naming convention (yes it's my fault). it is getting sort of mad. the 
  names are far too long, they should be put into separate packages and 
  shortened where possible
   
  The definition of "defaults".  I don't care what anybody says the default 
  port is, ether parse the config file or throw a error, don't set it 
  randomly to something I don't use
  
  The plugin architecture: there is no plugin architecture. in a later
  release this project will be moved to a plugin framework 
  -> http://jpf.sourceforge.net/index.html or a similar framework
  
  The configuration architecture: there is no configuration architecture.
  in a later release a xml based configuration file will be created in 
  the xmms2 client directory (or closer to the client?)
  -> utfg  
  
 Things I really want to do:
 
  combobox magic: set combobox back to editable, if you enter a name unknown
  a popup will ask you if you want to create it, if the name is known it will
  be selected
  
  sashform magic: allow multible children (currently old workaround has been
  ported
  
  clean up the new window (i made a big mess there)
  
  i want my swt tray! (it was the reason for a whole day of pain)
