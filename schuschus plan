This part is about the things that are wrong in the current version:

  The naming convention (yes it's my fault). it is getting sort of mad. the 
  names are far too long, they should be put into separate packages and 
  shortened where possible

  The action architecture: different backends have different actions,
  forcing a playlist backend to have a play selected action is imply wrong
  -> a keypress event will be send to the backends actionhandler(?) and 
     will there do whatever it is supposed to do
     
  The definition of "defaults". God damn it is annoying during testing if 
  that stupid window doesn't show up until i klick that trayicon.
  I don't care what anybody says the default port is, ether parse the config
  file or throw a error, don't set it randomly to something I don't use
  
  The trayicon. upload the damn png and do something about transparency
  -> https://jdic.dev.java.net/ is somewhere mentioned to have a better 
     trayicon
  
  The plugin architecture: there is no plugin architecture. in a later
  release this project will be moved to a plugin framework 
  -> http://jpf.sourceforge.net/index.html or a similar framework
  
  The configuration architecture: there is no configuration architecture.
  in a later release a xml based configuration file will be created in 
  the xmms2 client directory (or closer to the client?)
  -> utfg
