This part is about the things that are wrong in the current version:

  The documentation. 

  The naming convention (yes it's my fault). it is getting sort of mad. the 
  names are far too long, they should be put into separate packages and 
  shortened where possible
   
  The definition of "defaults".  I don't care what anybody says the default 
  port is, ether parse the config file or throw a error, don't set it 
  randomly to something I don't use
  
  The trayicon. no interface, starts itself, sanity in loader!
  -> https://jdic.dev.java.net/ branch trayicon, so far no success
  
  The plugin architecture: there is no plugin architecture. in a later
  release this project will be moved to a plugin framework 
  -> http://jpf.sourceforge.net/index.html or a similar framework
  
  The configuration architecture: there is no configuration architecture.
  in a later release a xml based configuration file will be created in 
  the xmms2 client directory (or closer to the client?)
  -> utfg
