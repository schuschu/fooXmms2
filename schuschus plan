******************************************************************************

This part is about the things that are wrong in the current version:

  The documentation. it is getting a little messy... (no volunteers?)
  
  The Readme.... 
   
  The definition of "defaults".  I don't care what anybody says the default 
  port is, ether parse the config file or throw a error, don't set it 
  randomly to something I don't use
  
  The plugin architecture: there is no plugin architecture. in a later
  release this project will be moved to a plugin framework 
  -> http://jpf.sourceforge.net/index.html or a similar framework
  
  The configuration architecture: there is no configuration architecture.
  in a later release a xml based configuration file will be created in 
  the xmms2 client directory (or closer to the client?)
  -> utfg  
  
  PlaylistBackend still generates information (filteredContent), but it 
  is no longer needed (it is only a switcher between playlists and no longer
  has any filter functionality (recycle code for collections switcher?) 
  
  MediaPlaylist still generates filtered content, not needed -> mayor rewrite
  of interfaces and backends
  
  I should stop reusing functions for other purposes (see above)
  
  PlaylistBackend refreshes on playlist shuffle (FooPlaylistWatch), is this
  needed? Yes since it shares a broadcast with any other playlist manipulation
  
  LoadPlaylist watch loads playlist again, because there is no difference 
  between a change in the userinterface and the watchplaylistload function
  
  Icon/Pixmap mess!!! 
  
  Replace JOptionpane with Messagebox/SWT dialogs
  
  Add abstaction for SWT.COLOR
  
  Create Debug from ViewElements
  
  Static client and icon
  
  Better way than getReal() in FooInterfaceViewElement

  
 Things I really want to do:
 
  combobox magic: set combobox back to editable, if you enter a name unknown
  a popup will ask you if you want to create it, if the name is known it will
  be selected; http://sourceforge.net/projects/swtaddons/

  XML magic: dynamic drawing of the ui

  try out if a list/table for playlists(instead of combo) is possible, and
  introduce tabbar
  
  Sliders: seekbar (broadcast strom ahead), volume
  
  id3 magic: want to edit tags via fooXmms2 (please be possible)
